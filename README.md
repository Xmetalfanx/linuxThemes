# This is in EXTREME TEST MODE right now


November 1, 2024: I am not 100% sure what i am doing with this repo but recently I am just trying to remove as much EOL code as I can and "whip" this repo into shape. There are a few things, like how I have the menus ... that I haven't done in the way I have it here, in years ..so that will need updating too.

Also I am not sure what I am doing with downloadable theming (maybe remove the themes, but keep icon pack downloads?) that hasn't been updated in a few years. The idea is that even if you can download them gtk updates over the years will cause those themes to break anyway .. so what is the point?
