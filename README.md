# linuxThemes
Repo to add Linux Themes, Icon Packs, and more ...

# This is in EXTREME TEST MODE right now

## The Plan
I am going to first fill out some themes and icon packs where the source is a third party site (Gnome-Looks, Github...etc etc) and downloads that ... I will then go back and where needed have for a "GTKPackX" ("Whatever GTK Theme... ")  

A) The Distro base you are on is detected and when you select GTKPackX... it goes through a check based on your distro to see if there is an option where GTKPackX is already in YOUR DISTROS repos and installs the theme that way ... even if a PPA may be needed say for Ubuntu based distros ....  IF that option doesn't exist, it will default to ... say download that theme from github and doing (my scripts) what it needs to do that way.
